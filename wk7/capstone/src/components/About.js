      <h1>Our Story</h1>

      <p>Discount Outlet is a family-owned business that has had the pleasure of serving the local community for over 30 years. Our mission is to provide the best name brand retail merchandise to our local community at the lowest prices in the market! We currently have two retail store locations in Massillon and Canton, Ohio.

      We buy overstock liquidation at crazy low prices and serve that savings back to the customer! Our belief is that we should pass along the savings with our customers because they are family. Our family is what has made Discount Outlet so successful over the previous 30 years and to them, we say thank you!

      Our goal is to continue serving the best name brand merchandise at the lowest prices to our family! So please come and join our family today by searching our newest deals, checking out our weekly ad, or visiting us at our store locations!</p>
